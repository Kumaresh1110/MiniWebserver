1. Name : Kumaresh Vijayakumar /Date (Month/Date/Year) 10-09-2022

2. Java version used for the execution of addition program :
java version "18.0.2.1" 2022-08-18
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 18.0.2.1+1-1)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.2.1+1-1, mixed mode, sharing)

3. Steps followed to run this code:
       - Place WebAdd.html file and MiniWebserver.java code in your device with in the folder.
       - Proceed further by compiling and executing the MiniWebserver.java.	
       - Now open the HTML file WebAdd.html and it will navigate to the localhost at port 2540 
         file:///C:/Users/Kumaresh/Documents/Test/WebAdd.html
       - Now, enter the Name of Person, First Number and Second Number values
       - Hit Submit button.
       - A new HTML page with the localhost along with the required output displayed in the same HTML page.
       -You can repeatedly submit the dataâ€™s without reloading the html web browser
4.Answers for checklist Questions:
   a. Question_1 in the Checklist:  Explained how MIME-types are used to tell the browser what data is coming.
   Answer: MIME types help us to disturb the data which is sent from the server.  This shows the format used to disturb the data from the server. They can be also mentioned as Media Types. Here is a example, if the server is sending a plain text message as a input data which is given by the user client browser understands it and it displays the text into the web browser.
	    It need not be disturbed. For a change consider the text is coming from the server it should show up all the elements found on the html in the respective user interface before showing the output result to the client side user. So, considering the both of the cases mentioned previously here there are completely different type of details is sent here MIME types 
	    shows us exactly the body of message with its form. Hence MIME type is a type of identifier. The client and server use this type of technique how the body is being disturbed. Multiple MIME types are available : image/jpeg, video/3gpp etc. Here in MiniWebserver we have used "text/html" MIME type which is also mentioned in the program.  This MIME type is written in the content type header in the HTTP. This content type shows the body of the response given but the client user. This is the technique that shows MIME types are used to talk about the incoming data to the browser.


   b. Question_2 in the checklist: Explained how you would return the contents of requested files (web pages) of type HTML (text/html)
   Answer: For the contents of the webpages to be returned of type HTML
	I should:
	--> Establish the connection with the server at port 2540 and client.
	--> Then Open the HTML file at the mentioned URL/link and have to assure the request is sent from the user side.
	--> Next, we have to parse the file name and read in all the contents of HTML to variables if this is needed to perform.
	--> After parsing the file name start calculating with the inputs given by the user.
	--> Next to calculations html response is built with header and sent.
	--> At last, after sending response close the connection between client and server.


   c. Question_3 in the checklist: Explained how you would return the contents of requested files (web pages) of type TEXT (text/plain)
   Answer: For the contents of the webpages to be returned of type HTML
	I should:
	--> Establish the connection with the server at port 2540 and client.
	--> Then start the parsing of file name in the beginning itself.
	--> Now open the given file and read in all the contents of the text file which is given.
	--> Here we start to build the HTTP response and should have a correct charset which is mentioned for the text in HTTP header. (This helps in encoding)
	--> Now have to send the details of the header with the response attached.
	--> At last after sending response close the connection between client and server.
